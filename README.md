# Pearl-Hacks-2018

This project was developed using XCode and is the beginnings of an iPhone app GUI but still has very limited functionality.

The idea for the app was to allow children to create wish lists for events like birthdays and Christmas by scanning the bar codes of items they want in stores and saving those items to the app. They would then share that list with people like their parents or grandparents.
